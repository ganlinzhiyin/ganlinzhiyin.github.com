         <h3>关于我们</h3>
               
                <p>甘霖之音敬拜团源于小组团契的日常敬拜。  "From Behind Closed Doors" 是该团契的英文名，正如马太福音6章6节，主耶稣教导寻求他的人，"你祷告的时候，要进你的内屋，关上门，祷告你在暗中的父；你父在暗中察看，必然报答你。" ； 另一层意思是，这些歌诞生于中国内陆。每首歌都是年轻的弟兄姐妹在聚会祷告敬拜时，全心呼求聆听我们、爱我们的全能造物主所得的灵感。</p>
                <p>“你是我的唯一”是甘霖之音第一张专辑的主题曲。多年来，这些歌在团契肢体经历试炼、患难或巅峰之时作成，每首歌都交织着基督救赎的真理与生命所有问题之解。</p>
				
				<p>到目前为止，甘霖之音未曾征收任何支持， 单通过自有资金支付录音和发行现有的16首曲目的费用。我们愿这些歌成为你及同伴与神同行之时的祝福。你若愿意在经济方面给我们支持，使更多的专辑得以发行，您所支付的所有款项将被用于专辑的制作及在中国内陆的发行。</p>

                <h3>About Us</h3>
<hr />
				<p>Ganlinzhiyin is a worship group that was birthed out of genuine times of worship before our awesome Creator.  "From Behind Closed Doors" is the English name of the group, in keeping with the Matthew 6:6 passage, where Jesus instructs those seeking Him to "go into your room and close your door."  The double meaning is that these songs were birthed from behind closed doors in China's mainland.  Each of these songs came into existence through inspired times of corporate worship as believing young people assembled to cry out to an Almighty loving Creator who is always listening. </p>
				
				<p>"Ni shi wode wei yi" is ganlinzhiyin's cover song of their first album, as it was the first of a series of songs that followed.  Over the years as these songs were written during times of trials, hardships, and mountain top experiences for the fellowship they came out of, each song is weaved with the redemptive truths of Christ as the answer to life's every question. </p>
				<p>Until now, ganlinzhiyin has not asked for any support, but has out of pocket paid for the expenses of recording and distribution of the current 16 songs.  We hope that these songs will be a blessing to you in your walk with God, and to the people that you share them with.  If you would like to help us financially to keep the songs coming, any money given will go directly towards the production of future songs, and their distribution throughout China's mainland. </p>
               <p>Please give us feedback!  And keep checking back to our site, as we will keep updating it with new content.</p>
